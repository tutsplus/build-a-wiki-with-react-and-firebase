React is a powerful and performant JavaScript library. In this course, Tuts+ instructor Andrew Burgess will show you how to use it to build a multi-user web application from start to finish. 

You'll also learn how to use Firebase, a cloud-hosted data backend for web and mobile applications. In this course, you'll use Firebase to implement a very simple JSON-based data store for the course project:  a live collaborative wiki.
